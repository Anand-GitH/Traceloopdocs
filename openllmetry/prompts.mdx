You can use Traceloop to manage your prompts and model configurations.
That way you can easily experiement with different prompts, run pre-defined tests, and rollout changes gradually and safely.

To enable this on the SDK, you'll need to set an environment variable: `TRACELOOP_PROMPT_REGISTRY_ENABLED=true`.

Assume you created the following prompt with the key `joke_generator` in the UI:

```
Tell me a joke about OpenTelemetry as a {{persona}}
```

Then, you can retrieve it with `get_prompt`:

```python
from traceloop.sdk.prompts import get_prompt

prompt_args = get_prompt("joke_generator", persona="pirate")
completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(**prompt_args)
```

<Tip>
  The returned variable `prompt_args` is compatible with the API used by the
  foundation models SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) which means you can directly
  plug in the response to the appropriate API call.

## Quick Start

### Configuring your prompt

### Testing your prompt configuration (Prompt Playground)

By using the prompt playground you will be able to re-iterate and refine your prompt before deploying it.

In order to test your newly defined prompt you can use the playground feature.
In the right tab menu select the variables tab.
This tab will contain all the variable names which is declared in your prompt template.
Assign value to each of them, and then click the `Test` button in the playground section at the bottom of the page.
Once you click the test button your prompt template will be rendered with the values you provided and will be sent to the configured LLM with the model configuration define and the completion including the tokens usage will appear.
