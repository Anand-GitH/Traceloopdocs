You can contribute both new instrumentations or update and improve the different SDKs.

[Join our Slack community](https://traceloop.com/slack) to chat and get help on any issues you may encounter.

The Python and Typescript are monorepos that use [nx](https://nx.dev) to manage the different packages.
Make sure you have `node >= 18` and `nx` installed globally.

## Basic guide for using nx

Most commands can be run from the root of the project. For example, to lint the entire project, run:

```bash
nx run-many -t lint
```

Other commands you can use simiarily are `test`, or `build`, or `lock` and `install` (for Python).

To run a specific command on a specific package, run:

```bash
nx run <package>:<command>
```

## Python

We use `poetry` to manage packages, and each package is managed independently under its own directory under `/packages`.
All instrumentations depends on `opentelemetry-semantic-conventions-ai`,
and `traceloop-sdk` depends on all the instrumentations.

If adding a new instrumentation, make sure to use it in `traceloop-sdk`, and write proper tests.

### Debugging

No matter if you're working on an instrumentation or on the SDK, we recommend testing the changes by using
the SDK in the sample app (`/packages/sample-app`) or the tests under the SDK.

### Running tests

All tests are currently under `packages/python-sdk`. Since we wanted to simulate a real environment,
the tests make actual calls to OpenAI and other services.
To run them, you'll need to set up the following env vars:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
PINECONE_API_KEY=...
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=...
```

Run the tests using:

```bash
cd packages/python-sdk
poetry install
poetry run pytest
```

## Typescript

We use `npm` with workspaces to manage packages in the monorepo. Install by running `npm install` in the root of the project.
Each package has its own test suite. You can use the sample app to run and test changes locally.
