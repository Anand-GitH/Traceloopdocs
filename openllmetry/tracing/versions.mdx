## Workflow Versions

You can version your workflows and tasks. Just provide the `version` argument to the decorator:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
@workflow(name="my_workflow", version=2)
def my_workflow():
    ...
```
</CodeGroup>

## Prompt Versions

You can enrich your prompt traces by providing data about the prompt's version, specifying the prompt template or the variables:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
Traceloop.set_prompt(
    "Tell me a joke about {subject}", {"subject": subject}, version=1
)
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Tell me a joke about {subject}"}],
)
```
</CodeGroup>
