Calls to LLMs are connected to entities in your own application. 
These can be things like `user_id`, `chat_id`, or anything else that is tied to the flow that triggered a trace.

OpenLLMetry allows you to easily mark traces with these IDs so you can track them in the UI.

```python Python
Tracer.set_association_properties({ "user_id": "user12345", "chat_id": "chat12345" })
```

<Note>
Older versions of OpenLLMetry (before 0.0.62), used the `set_correlation_id` method to set a single ID.
If you're using this API, you should switch to the new `set_association_properties` method. `set_correlation_id` will be removed in a future version.
