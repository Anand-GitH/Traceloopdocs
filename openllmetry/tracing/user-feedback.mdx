title: "Tracking User Feedback"
---

When building LLM applications, it quickly becomes highly useful and important to track user feedback on the result of your LLM workflow.

Doing that with OpenLLMetry is easy. First, make sure you [associate your LLM workflow with unique identifiers](/openllmetry/tracing/association).

Then, you can use OpenLLMetry client-side SDK to track user feedback.
