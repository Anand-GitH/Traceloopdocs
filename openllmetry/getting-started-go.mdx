<Steps>
<Step title="Install the SDK">

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go get "github.com/traceloop/go-openllmetry"
```

In your LLM app, initialize the Traceloop tracer like this:

```go
import traceloop "github.com/traceloop/go-openllmetry"

func main() {
    tracer := traceloop.NewTracer()
    defer tracer.Close()
}
```

</Step>
<Step title="Log your prompts">

</Frame>
For now, we don't automatically instrument libraries on Go (as opposed to Python and Javascript).
This will change in later versions.

This means that you'll need to manually log your prompts and completions.

```go
import (
    openai "github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai"
    traceloop "github.com/traceloop/go-openllmetry"
)

func call_llm() {
    client := openai.NewClient("your token")

    // Log the prompt
    tracer.LogPrompt("gpt-3.5-turbo", "Tell me a joke about OpenTelemetry")

    // Call OpenAI like you normally would
    resp, err := client.CreateChatCompletion(
		context.Background(),
		openai.ChatCompletionRequest{
			Model: openai.GPT3Dot5Turbo,
			Messages: []openai.ChatCompletionMessage{
				{
					Role:    openai.ChatMessageRoleUser,
					Content: "Tell me a joke about OpenTelemetry!",
				},
			},
		},
	)

    // Pass the response form OpenAI as is to log the completion and token usage
    tracer.LogResponse(resp)
}
```

}

</Step>
<Step title="Configure trace exporting">
Lastly, you'll need to configure where to export your traces.
The 2 environment variables controlling this are `TRACELOOP_API_KEY` and `TRACELOOP_BASE_URL`.

For Traceloop, read on. For other options, see [Exporting](/openllmetry/integrations/introduction).

### Using Traceloop Cloud

Go to [Traceloop](https://app.traceloop.com), and create a new account.
Then, click on **Environments** on the left-hand navigation bar. Or go to directly to https://app.traceloop.com/settings/api-keys.
Click **Generate API Key** to generate an API key for the developement environment and click **Copy API Key** to copy it over.

<Warning>Make sure to copy it as it won't be shown again.</Warning>

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/apikey.png" />
</Frame>

Set the copied Traceloop's API key as an environment variable in your app named `TRACELOOP_API_KEY`.

Done! You'll get instant visibility into everything that's happening with your LLM.
If you're calling a vector DB, or any other external service or database, you'll also see it in the Traceloop dashboard.
