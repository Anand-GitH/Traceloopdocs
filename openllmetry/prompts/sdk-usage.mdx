### Using your prompt

To enable the prompt feature on the Traceloop SDK, you'll need to set the environment variable: `TRACELOOP_PROMPT_REGISTRY_ENABLED=true`.

You must also configure the SDK with your API Key for a particular environment. See the [SDK documentation](/openllmetry/configuration#api-key) for more information.

<Info>
  The Traceloop SDK will automatically fetch updates you make to your prompts.
  This way, you can deploy your prompt changes without having to redeploy your
  application.
</Info>

After creating a with the key `joke_generator` in the UI with the following prompt:

```
Tell me a joke about OpenTelemetry as a {{persona}}
```

Then, you can retrieve it with in your code using `get_prompt`:

```python
from traceloop.sdk.prompts import get_prompt

prompt_args = get_prompt("joke_generator", persona="pirate")
completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(**prompt_args)
```

<Tip>
  The returned variable `prompt_args` is compatible with the API used by the
  foundation models SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) which means you can directly
  plug in the response to the appropriate API call.
